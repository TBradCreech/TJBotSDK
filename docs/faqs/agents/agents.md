#Frequently Asked Questions: Agents

###Here is a collection of FAQs specific to the agent mechanism in Intu

* When the output of an agent is of interest to other agents, does it have to first publish the results to the blackboard, with the rest of the agents then listening to grab the input, or does the communication happen beneath the blackboard layer?
  * Sample answer

* What is the driver behind writing the agents in C++ instead of other languages?
  * Sample answer

* What is the specification for defining an agent?
  * Sample answer

* Where do the agents sit? Locally? In the cloud? Or is it some hybrid of the two?
  * Sample answer

* How does one access the agents? They do not appear to be visible when launching the avatar or the manager.
  * Sample answer

* When a goal agent determines the plan, are other agents also working in parallel? Or do they wait until the goal agent determines the plan of action, and then carry out the action required to achieve the outcome?
  * Sample answer

* When you start Intu, do all of the agents start up? Or only the ones subscribed to the topic of interest?
  * Sample answer

* When return data comes back from Bluemix and other services, does the individual piece gets taken on by the agents and published into the topics of the blackboard, which is then pushed back to the client via a "super" agent? Or does the data get taken by the agents and pushed straight back to avatar?
  * Sample answer

* How do you define autonomous vs reactive behaviour of agents? How do they work?
  * Sample answer

* When an agent is added locally, the code to create it is added locally in Intu config file. If an agent is added/configured in the cloud, can the code then reside in the cloud? Any changes can then be pushed to the user's machine. Surely it is not practical to update the config locally on every single machine that has Intu.
  * Sample answer

* How would we have local agents talk to agents on the cloud?
  * Sample answer

* Can we see the different agents in Bluemix?
  * Sample answer

* How does one install custom agents?
  * Sample answer

* What does the vanilla structure of an empty agent look like?
  * Sample answer

* Every time we add an agent(behavior), do we have to rebuild Intu? Are there any other ways of adding agents? (Adding to the config file)
  * Sample answer

* How would one configure multiple agents from one location?
  * Sample answer

* What is the difference between intent and agent, and how do they work together?
  * Sample answer
