# Workshop 5 – Running Intu on a Raspberry Pi

In this workshop, you will assemble your own Raspberry Pi, which is a credit card-sized computer. You will then program an LED gesture for Intu, and run Intu off of your Raspberry Pi and see your LED gesture in action.

**Before you begin:** 

1. You must have a Mac or Windows laptop, and you must have completed Workshop 1: Say Hello!. After completing Workshop 1, you will have:

	1. Your own account, Organization, Group and Parent on the [Intu Gateway](rg-`gateway.mybluemix.net`)
	2. Your own [Intu Gateway](rg-`gateway.mybluemix.net`) credentials 

2. You must have the following to complete Workshop 5:
	* Raspberry Pi 3 with power cable
	* Anker Bluetooth Speaker with power cable and 3.5mm audio cable
	* USB Mini Microphone
	* PiCamera for the Raspberry Pi 3
	* Neopixel RGB LED
	* Monitor (with a HDMI connection)
	* Keyboard and Mouse (with USB connections)
	* An imaged 32 GB SD card

3. You will notice that Intu and Self are used interchangeably. Self is the technical name for Intu.  

**Notes:** 

1. If you **do not** have an imaged card from Devcon, please go to the **Appendix** after assembling your Raspberry Pi.	

2. In this workshop, commands are issued from **Terminal** on **Mac** or **PuTTY** on **Windows**. For **Windows** users, if you do not have **PuTTY** installed, you can download it using this [link](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html). **Windows** users will also require a file management tool to copy files over a network between their local machine and the Raspberry Pi. You can use a stand-alone tool like **Filezilla**, or you may prefer scp via Putty. **Filezilla** can be downloaded using this [link](https://filezilla-project.org/).

### C. Camera

1.	Locate the connector situated to the **right** of the HDMI port.

2.	Pull the tabs on the top of the connector **upwards** and then **away** from the HDMI port.

3.	Insert the camera’s flex cable firmly into the connector, taking care not to bend the cable at too sharp an angle.

4.	The top part of the connector should then be pushed towards the HDMI port and down while the flex cable is held in place.

5.	Refer to the image below for a properly assembled camera.

	![Camera.](https://github.ibm.com/watson-labs-austin/self-sdk/blob/develop/docs/workshops-devcon/5/lab-docs/camera4.png?raw=true)

### D. LED

1.	Obtain the following parts:
	1.	Neopixel RGB LED
	2.	Two female-female jumper wiresNeopixel_RGB_LED.jpg

	![Neopixel RGB LED](https://github.ibm.com/watson-labs-austin/self-sdk/blob/develop/docs/workshops-devcon/5/lab-docs/neopixel_RGB_LED.jpg?raw=true)

2.	Connect Jumper Wire 1 to the GND pin. This is called the **cathode** pin

3.	Connect Jumper Wire 2 to the +3.3V pin. This is called the **anode** pin

4.	Now position your Raspberry Pi such that the **power cable** is on the **bottom**. Connect the **Cathode end** to **pin #3** on the **top row**. Then connect the **Anode end ** to **pin #4** on the **bottom row**. Refer to the image below for a fully assembled Raspberry Pi.

### E. Power

To power up your Raspberry Pi, connect the power cable to your Raspberry Pi as shown in the image below. 

![Power cable for Raspberry Pi.](https://github.ibm.com/watson-labs-austin/self-sdk/blob/develop/docs/workshops-devcon/5/lab-docs/pi_charger.png?raw=true)

### F. Connecting the Raspberry Pi to an external monitor, keyboard and mouse

Connect your Raspberry Pi to an external monitor, keyboard and mouse as shown in the image below.

![Raspberry Pi and external connections.](https://github.ibm.com/watson-labs-austin/self-sdk/blob/develop/docs/workshops-devcon/5/lab-docs/external_monitor_keyboard_to_pi.png?raw=true)

## 2. Set up the Wi-Fi connection for your Raspberry Pi

1. Insert your SD card into your Raspberry Pi if you have not done so already.

2. Connect your Raspberry Pi to a power source, and connect an external keyboard, mouse and monitor to your Raspberry Pi.

3. You should see a window open on your monitor. Sometimes it might so happen that your power strip might not work correctly. If your Pi does not start, plug it directly into a wall socket. Click on the **Wifi networks** icon ![wifi](https://github.ibm.com/watson-labs-austin/self-sdk/blob/develop/docs/workshops-devcon/5/lab-docs/wifi.png?raw=true) at the top of the window, select your network (at DevCon, it will be **ROBOT_PED1**), and enter your password (**panda$123** for ROBOT_PED1).

4.	Get the IP address of your Raspberry Pi.
	1.	Click on the black **Terminal** icon on the top left toolbar.
	2.	Type in `ifconfig` and hit Enter.
	3. Look for the **wlan0** section. The **inet addr** gives you the IP address of your Raspberry Pi (e.g. 10.0.1.2). 

5.	**Important:** Ensure that your laptop is on the **same** network as your Raspberry Pi from this point onwards.
	
	**For Mac users:**
	1. Open a new Terminal window, and connect to the Raspberry Pi using: `ssh pi@{pi's_IP_address}` (e.g. ssh pi@10.0.1.2)
	2. You will be prompted for the Raspberry Pi's password. The default password is **raspberry**.

	**For Windows users:** 
	
	1. Open a new PuTTY window and type in the Raspberry Pi's IP address. 
	2. You will be prompted for the Raspberry Pi's username and password. The default username is **pi** and default password is **raspberry**.

6. At this point, you can disconnect the external monitor, mouse and keyboard from the Raspberry Pi. **Do not disconnect the Raspberry Pi from its power source.**

7. Check that your laptop is still on the same network as the Raspberry Pi, and reboot the Raspberry Pi by running `sudo reboot` in your SSH window (Terminal for Mac and PuTTY for Windows). Try SSHing back into the Pi - when you can, the Pi is back up and running.

**Note:** Unless explicitly stated, all of the following steps are to be run on your local computer.

## 3. Download the Self SDK onto your computer and add in the code for the LED gesture

### A. Download the Self SDK

1. [Download the Self SDK](https://github.com/watson-intu/self-sdk). Make sure the branch is master and click on download.
2. Create a new directory named **intu** in your **home** directory.

3. Unzip the **wlabs_self-sdk-master.zip** file into **intu**, making sure that you retain the folder structure, i.e. your intu directory should now contain the unzipped **wlabs_self-sdk-master** folder. This may take some time.

### B. Creating the LED gesture on OS X

1. If you do not have it installed already, download the trial version of the [CLion C++ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/).

2. In **CLion**, select Open -> home directory -> intu -> wlabs_self-sdk-master and click **OK**. 

	Note that a window may appear prompting you to open your project in a New Window or This Window. Select **New Window**. At the bottom of your CLion window, in the Problems tab, you will see the following Error, which you do not need to worry about:
	
	```
	Error: By not providing "FindSELF.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "SELF", but CMake did not find one.
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "SELF" with any of the following names:
  SELFConfig.cmake   self-config.cmake
Add the installation prefix of "SELF" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "SELF_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "SELF" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
	```

 2i. Inside the CLion **wlabs_self-sdk-master project**, right-click **examples**, select **New**, and select **Directory**. Type in **workshop_five** for the new directory name, and click **OK**.
 
 2ii. Right-click the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the **examples** directory, and click **Copy**. (If you are unsure of the directory you are in, look in the top-left navigation bar.)
  
 2iii. Right-click the **workshop_five** directory, and click **Paste**. This file helps to build the plugin for the the LED gesture.

 2iv. Open the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the **workshop_five** directory, and overwrite all of its contents with the following code:

  ```
	include_directories(. wiringPI)
	SET(GCC_COVERAGE_LINK_FLAGS "-lwiringPi")
	add_definitions(${GCC_COVERAGE_LINK_FLAGS})

	file(GLOB_RECURSE SELF_CPP RELATIVE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} "*.cpp")
	qi_create_lib(workshop_five_plugin SHARED ${SELF_CPP})
	qi_use_lib(workshop_five_plugin self wdc)
	qi_stage_lib(workshop_five_plugin)

	target_link_libraries(workshop_five_plugin wiringPi)
  ```

3. Create a new directory inside **workshop_five** called **gestures**.

4. Locate the Workshop 5 code snippet files **to be filled in** in:

 `wlabs_self-sdk-master/docs/workshops-devcon/5/code-snippets/WorkshopFiveGesture_start`

5. Copy the `WorkshopFiveGesture.cpp` and the `WorkshopFiveGesture.h` files and paste them into the **gestures** directory that you created.

	* Open the `WorkshopFiveGesture.cpp` file, which contains the following functions that enable the gesture you'll create:

	* The Execute, Abort, AnimateThread and AnimateDone functions are already completely built out.

	* In the next step, you will build out the **DoAnimateThread** function using the example code provided.

6. In **wlabs_****self-sdk-master/docs/workshops-devcon/5/code-snippets/WorkshopFive_Snippets**, you will see the `WorkshopFiveCodeSnippets.txt` file. Open this file and find the **DoAnimateThread** function.

7. Copy the entire contents of `WorkshopFiveCodeSnippets.txt ` for the **DoAnimateThread()** function. Paste this inside the function body **{}** of **DoAnimateThread()** in `WorkshopFiveGesture.cpp` located in your **gestures** directory, directly above the line of code which reads: `Log::Debug("WorkshopFiveGesture", "in DoAnimateThread");`. The code which you need is displayed below for completeness; however, it is **not** recommended for you to copy it from here due to formatting issues.


  ```
    std::vector<AnimationEntry> anims;
    for(size_t i=0;i<m_Animations.size();++i)
    {
        anims.push_back( m_Animations[i] );
    }

    if ( anims.size() > 0 )
    {
        srand( (unsigned int)Time().GetMilliseconds() );
        const AnimationEntry & entry = anims[ rand() % anims.size() ];
        Log::Debug( "WorkshopFiveGesture", "Gesture %s is running behavior %s.", m_GestureId.c_str(), entry.m_AnimId.c_str() );

        if ( !m_bWiredPi )
        {
            wiringPiSetup();
            pinMode(m_PinNumber, OUTPUT);
            m_bWiredPi = true;
        }
        for(size_t i=0;i<5;++i)
        {
            digitalWrite(m_PinNumber, HIGH);
            delay(200);
            digitalWrite(m_PinNumber, LOW);
            delay(200);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        Log::Warning( "WorkshopFiveGesture", "No valid animations found for gesture %s", m_GestureId.c_str() );
    }
    
    ```

8. Save your changes (**Cmd + S**). 

### C. Creating the LED gesture on Windows

1.	Open up File Explorer and navigate to your **home** directory. This should be: **C:\Users\username** ("username" should read your name)

2. In your home directory, create a new directory called **workshop_five**, and a second directory called **gestures** inside **workshop_five**.

3. Navigate to **wlabs_****self-sdk-master/docs/workshops-devcon/5/code-snippets/WorkshopFiveGesture_Start/**, where you will find the following two files:
	
	`WorkshopFiveGesture.cpp` 
	
	`WorkshopFiveGesture.h`
		
4. Copy `WorkshopFiveGesture.cpp` and `WorkshopFiveGesture.h` from **WorkshopFiveGesture_Start/** to the **gestures** directory which you just created.
	
5. Now navigate to **wlabs_****self-sdk-master/docs/workshops-devcon/5/code-snippets/WorkshopFiveGesture_Snippets** and locate the `WorkshopFiveCodeSnippets.txt` file and find the **DoAnimateThread** function.

6. Copy the entire contents of `WorkshopFiveCodeSnippets.txt ` for the **DoAnimateThread()** function. Paste this inside the function body **{}** of **DoAnimateThread()** in `WorkshopFiveGesture.cpp` located in your **gestures** directory, directly above the line of code which reads: `Log::Debug("WorkshopFiveGesture", "in DoAnimateThread");`. The code which you need is displayed below for completeness; however, it is **not** recommended for you to copy it from here due to formatting issues.


  ```
    std::vector<AnimationEntry> anims;
    for(size_t i=0;i<m_Animations.size();++i)
    {
        anims.push_back( m_Animations[i] );
    }

    if ( anims.size() > 0 )
    {
        srand( (unsigned int)Time().GetMilliseconds() );
        const AnimationEntry & entry = anims[ rand() % anims.size() ];
        Log::Debug( "WorkshopFiveGesture", "Gesture %s is running behavior %s.", m_GestureId.c_str(), entry.m_AnimId.c_str() );

        if ( !m_bWiredPi )
        {
            wiringPiSetup();
            pinMode(m_PinNumber, OUTPUT);
            m_bWiredPi = true;
        }
        for(size_t i=0;i<5;++i)
        {
            digitalWrite(m_PinNumber, HIGH);
            delay(200);
            digitalWrite(m_PinNumber, LOW);
            delay(200);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        Log::Warning( "WorkshopFiveGesture", "No valid animations found for gesture %s", m_GestureId.c_str() );
    }
    
    ```
 
7.	Navigate to the **workshop_five** directory you created in your home directory, and create a new text file called `CMakeLists.txt`. 

8. Open this file and add in the following lines of code:

	```
	include_directories(. wiringPI)
	SET(GCC_COVERAGE_LINK_FLAGS "-lwiringPi")
	add_definitions(${GCC_COVERAGE_LINK_FLAGS})

	file(GLOB_RECURSE SELF_CPP RELATIVE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} "*.cpp")
	qi_create_lib(workshop_five_plugin SHARED ${SELF_CPP})
	qi_use_lib(workshop_five_plugin self wdc)
	qi_stage_lib(workshop_five_plugin)

	target_link_libraries(workshop_five_plugin wiringPi)

	```
	
9. Save your changes (**Ctrl + S**).

### B. Configuring your `body.json` file

**For Mac users:**

1. Open your `body.json` file which is in path /home/pi/self/self-sdk-master/bin/raspi/etc/profile/body.json using your favorite text editor. 

2. Locate the `m_Libs` variable, and change it to read: `"m_Libs":["platform_raspi", "workshop_five_plugin"]`

3. Locate `"m_EmbodimentCreds":{ ... }`, and replace this with the complete set of credentials you copied over into your text editor from the section above ie 5.A.

4. Save your changes and close the file.

**For Windows users:**

1. Open Filezilla and connect to your Raspberry Pi.

2. On the **Remote site** side of the Filezilla screen, navigate to **/home/pi/self/self-sdk-master/bin/raspi/etc/profile**.

3. Locate the `body.json` file in the profile directory, and right click and select **View/Edit**.

4. Locate the `m_Libs` variable, and change it to read: `"m_Libs":["platform_raspi", "workshop_five_plugin"]`

4. Locate `"m_EmbodimentCreds":{ ... }`, and replace this with the complete set of credentials you copied over into your text editor from the section above ie 5.A.

6. Exit the window you were using to edit the `body.json` file, upon which you will be prompted to upload the file back onto the server.

7. Click **Yes**. This action saves your changes to your Raspberry Pi.

### C. Building the Self SDK on your Raspberry Pi

1. In your current (or a new) SSH session to the Raspberry Pi, navigate to the **self-sdk-master** directory: `cd self-sdk-master`
	
2.	Mark the build script as executable by running: 
`chmod +x scripts/build_raspi.sh`

3.	Now build the Self SDK by running: `scripts/build_raspi.sh`
	
	**Note:** If you have any build errors, run: `scripts/clean.sh` and then rerun: `scripts/build_raspi.sh`

## 6. Run Intu on your Raspberry Pi

Run Intu on your Raspberry Pi by completing the following steps in your terminal window. 

**Note:** The following steps will need to be repeated each time you power up your Raspberry Pi (i.e. unplug and plug back in the power source to your Raspberry Pi).

1.	If you have a HDMI cable plugged into your Raspberry Pi, verify that the sound is set to **analog**. This can be done by right clicking the **speaker icon** at the top right hand corner of the Raspberry Pi's homescreen, and selecting **analog**. 

2.	Verify that you have a microphone and speaker plugged into your Raspberry Pi. Note that your speaker may need to be charged before use. Make sure that it is turned on before proceeding with the next step.

3.	Navigate to the **raspi** directory using: `cd /home/pi/self/self-sdk-master/bin/raspi`.

4.	Run: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./`

5.	Run: `export WIRINGPI_GPIOMEM=1`

6.	Run: `./self_instance `

**Note:** Each time you want to run Intu, you must follow steps 4-6 each time:

```
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./
	export WIRINGPI_GPIOMEM=1
	./self_instance 
```

You have now added a gesture for the LED light.  When you say, "Can you laugh?" or "Tell me a joke" to the robot, the LED light should blink, i.e. you have added the blinking of the LED to Intu as a gesture. 


### What did we learn?
When Intu is asked "can you laugh" or "tell me a joke" and the Blackboard receives a [emote=show_laugh], how does Intu know that the LED gesture should be executed?

It is from the configuration file `raspi.anims`, in `Intu/wlabs_self-sdk-master/bin/raspi/etc/gestures`. (More to come).

# Appendix: Instructions for Running Intu on a Raspberry Pi (Without a Pre-Imaged SD Card)
 
**Note:** Commands are assumed to be issued from **Terminal** on **Mac** or **PuTTY** on **Windows**. For **Windows** users, if you do not have **PuTTY** installed, you can download it using this [link](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html). **Windows** users will also require a file management tool to copy files over a network between their local machine and the Raspberry Pi. You can use a stand-alone tool like **Filezilla**. **Filezilla** can be downloaded using this [link](https://filezilla-project.org/).

## 1. Set up the Wi-Fi connection for your Raspberry Pi

1.	Connect your Raspberry Pi to a power source, and connect an external keyboard, mouse and monitor to your Raspberry Pi.

2.	You should see a window open on your monitor. Click on the **Wifi networks (w)** icon at the top of the window, select your network (at DevCon, it will be **ROBOT_PED1**), and enter your password (**panda$123**).

3.	Get the IP address of your Raspberry Pi.
	1.	Click on the black **Terminal** icon on the top left toolbar.
	2.	Type in **ifconfig** and hit Enter.
	3. Look for the **wlan0** section. The **inet addr** gives you the IP address of your Raspberry Pi (e.g. 10.0.1.2). 

4.	Ensure that your laptop is on the **same** network as your Raspberry Pi from this point onwards.
	
	For **Mac** users, open a new Terminal window, and connect to the Raspberry Pi using: `ssh pi@{ip_address}` (e.g. ssh pi@10.0.1.2)

	You will be prompted for a password. The default password for the Raspberry Pi is **raspberry**.

	For **Windows** users, open **PuTTY**, type in the Raspberry Pi's IP address, and when prompted, type in the username (**pi**) and password (**raspberry**) for the Raspberry Pi.

5. At this point, you can disconnect the external monitor, mouse and keyboard from the Raspberry Pi. **Do not disconnect the Raspberry Pi from its power source.**

6. Check that your laptop is on the same network as the Raspberry Pi. Reboot the Raspberry Pi by running `sudo reboot` in your SSH window. 

## 2. Install the Raspbian Operating System on your Raspberry Pi

1. Navigate to the [NOOBS Download page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/).

2. Click on the **Download ZIP** button under ‘NOOBS (offline and network install)’. **Note:** This may take an hour or more depending on your network speed. 

3. Extract the files from the zip to a local directory. 

4. Open the "Read Me" text file in the extracted folder and follow the instructions to format your SD card.

5. Once your SD card has been formatted, drag all the files within the extracted NOOBS folder and drop them onto the SD card.

6. The necessary files will then be transferred to your SD card.

7. When this process has finished, safely eject the SD card from your computer, remove the mini SD card from it, and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.

8. Connect your Raspberry Pi to a power source, and connect an external keyboard, mouse and monitor to your Raspberry Pi.

9.	You should see a window open on your monitor. Click on the **Wifi networks (w)** icon at the top of the window, select your network (at DevCon, it will be **ROBOT_PED1**), and enter your password (**panda$123**).

10. As this is the first time your Raspberry Pi and SD card have been used, you'll have to select an operating system and let it install. Select **Raspbian [RECOMMENDED]**.

11. At the bottom of your screen, you will see a **Language** panel for your keyboard. Select **English (US)**. 

12.	Click on the **Install** icon on the top left of the window. A **Confirm** window will appear; select **Yes**. The installation may take up to 30-40 mins. 

	**Note:** If your installation freezes at any point (as indicated by a frozen progress bar), **unplug** the Raspberry Pi from its power source and **plug it back in**, and repeat from step 8.

13.	Check that you are connected to the network. On the right of the Bluetooth icon in the top right corner of the screen, you will see a **successful connection** to your wifi network as shown by a **blue wifi icon**, or an **icon with two red crosses** if you have been **disconnected**. To reconnect, click on the two red crosses, select your network, and type in the password when prompted.

14. Get the IP address of your Raspberry Pi.
	1.	Click on the black **Terminal** icon on the top left toolbar.
	2.	Type in **ifconfig** and hit Enter. **Note:** If this command does not work, **unplug** the Raspberry Pi from its power source and **plug it back in**, and repeat this step.
	3. Look for the **wlan0** section. The **inet addr** gives you the IP address of your Raspberry (e.g. 10.0.1.2). 

15.	**Important:** Ensure that your laptop is on the **same** network as your Raspberry Pi from this point onwards.
	
	**For Mac users:**
	1. Open a new Terminal window, and connect to the Raspberry Pi using: `ssh pi@{pi's_IP_address}` (e.g. ssh pi@10.0.1.2)
	2. You will be prompted for the Raspberry Pi's password. The default password is **raspberry**.

	**For Windows users:** 
	
	1. Open a new PuTTY window and type in the Raspberry Pi's IP address. 
	2. You will be prompted for the Raspberry Pi's username and password. The default username is **pi** and default password is **raspberry**.

16. At this point, you can disconnect the external monitor, mouse and keyboard from the Raspberry Pi. 

17. Check that your laptop is on the same network as the Raspberry Pi. Reboot the Raspberry Pi by running `sudo reboot` in your SSH window. 

## 3. Setting up your Raspberry Pi for Builds

	4.	Now navigate into the wiringPi directory by running: `cd wiringPi/`
	
	5.	Run: `./build`

	You should see a list of classes compiled and "All Done" at the end.
	
5. Finally, in a new Terminal/PuTTY window, SSH into your Raspberry Pi, navigate to its home directory by running: `cd /home/pi` and in here, create a new directory called **self** by running: `mkdir self`. This directory will be used in the steps below.

## 4. Download the Self SDK and build Self on your Raspberry Pi


### A. Download the Self SDK

1. [Download the Self SDK](https://github.com/watson-intu/self-sdk). Click on the **download icon** next to the default **master** branch selected.

2. Copy the zip file from your local machine across to the Raspberry Pi.

	**For Mac users:**

	1. In a Terminal window, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the zip file, and copy it across to the newly created **self** directory on the Raspberry Pi using: `scp self-sdk-master.zip pi@{IPaddress}:/home/pi/self/`
	
	**For Windows users:**
 
 1. Open Filezilla and connect to your Raspberry Pi.
  
    	1. In the **Host** field, specify your Raspberry Pi's IP address.
		
		2. In the **Username** field, specify your Raspberry Pi's username (**pi**).
		
		3. In the **Password** field, specify your Raspberry Pi's password (**raspberry**).
		
		4. In the **Port** field, specify **22**. 

	2. In the **Local site** side of the screen, navigate to the `self-sdk-master.zip` file.
	
	3.	In the **Remote site** side of the screen, navigate to the directory: **/home/pi/self**
	
	4.	Click on the file `self-sdk-master.zip` on the **Local site** side of the screen and drag it to the **Remote site** side of the screen. You can monitor the progress of the transfer in the panel located at the bottom of the Filezilla screen.

	2.	Run the following command: `unzip self-sdk-master.zip`

4. Build Self on your Raspberry Pi with the following steps:

	1.	Navigate into the **self-sdk-master** directory on your Raspberry Pi: `cd self-sdk-master`
	
	2.	Mark the build script as executable by running: `chmod +x scripts/build_raspi.sh`
	
	3. Run: `scripts/clean.sh` 
	
	4. Run: `scripts/build_raspi.sh`

###You are now ready to proceed from **Section 3: Download the Self SDK onto your computer and add in the code for the LED gesture.** 

As you have already downloaded the `wlabs_self-sdk-master.zip` file, your first step will be **Section 3.A.2:** Create a new directory named **intu** in your **home** directory
.

**Code Overview**

1. All classes in Intu inherit from the ISerializable interface. All objects can be deserialized from the Deserialize function and serialized from the Serialize function. All deserialization and serialization occurs from the body.json file found in the etc/profiles directory.

2. The flow of how this gesture gets executed has led up to working on the previous workshops. In Workshop 2, you have configured a Conversation service to have it respond to questions in a variety of ways. One thing that can be done in Conversation is to add an `[emote=show_laugh]` tag after a response. The text that gets returned from the Conversation service eventually makes its way to the SpeakingAgent. The SpeakingAgent will see the `[emote=show_laugh]` tag, and create an Emotion object and place that on the Blackboard. The agent that was developed in Workshop 3 subscribes to Emotion objects on start up. In the callback, the OnEmotion() function will execute an AnimateGesture skill.

3. All gestures inherit from the IGesture interface. Therefore, all gestures have a Start(), Stop(), Execute(), and Abort():
  
  * **Start():** This function is called from the GestureManager class. If the function returns false, then the GestureManager will not register the gesture.
  
  * **Stop():** This function is called when the GestureManager is stopped
  
  * **Execute():** The main implementation on how to carry out the execution of the gesture. If we look at the top of the cpp file, you will see two macros defined: REG_SERIALIZABLE and RTTI_IMPL. REG_SERIALIZABLE will serialize the object type to our system so we can get a handle on it using reflection, while RTTI_IMPL states that our implementation of the class WorkshopFiveGesture will override our base AnimateGesture class. The power of this allows us to have platform specific code to carry out execution of gestures while still keeping the core Intu platform agnostic. Therefore, when AnimateGesture is called to execute, our WorkshopFiveAnimation execute function will be called.
  
  * **Abort():** Will stop the execution of the gesture if the gesture is still in progress.
